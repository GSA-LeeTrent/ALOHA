					The General Services Administration is committed to providing users with disabilities access to the	Authorized Leave and Overtime Help Application (ALOHA) system using provisions compliant with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act Guidelines. The
					accessibility statement for GSA websites may be reviewed at: <h:outputLink value="http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/116621">http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/116621</h:outputLink>
				</div>
				<div style="margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:10px;">
					To meet this commitment, ALOHA system is routinely reviewed and tested to make it as accessible as possible. If you use assistive technology (such as a
					screen reader, eye tracking device, voice recognition software, etc.) and have difficulty accessing
					ALOHA, please navigate to the Contact Us page and provide feedback. Please help us respond to you in
					the most helpful way by indicating the nature of your accessibility problem. An ALOHA team member
					will contact you.
